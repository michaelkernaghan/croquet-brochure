    <p>This layout tests both the tactical and stroke skills of players.</p>
    <h3>Navigating the Route</h3>
    <p>Players compete to pass their balls through the same hoop in the correct sequence. The sequence is critical and
        requires strategic planning to optimize each shot. See annotated diagram displaying the standard sequence of
        hoops, offering new players a visual path to follow.</p>
    <h3 class="new-page">Rules and Gameplay Procedures</h3>
    <p>Objective: The aim is to be the first to pass the ball through the designated hoop, scoring one point per hoop.
    </p>
    <p>Turns and Play: Players hit their balls once per turn, attempting to pass through the current hoop. The order is
        based on ball colour - Blue, Red, Black, Yellow. The Blue and Black are partners, as are the Yellow and Red.</p>
    <p>Strategic Plays: Blocking and clearing opponent's balls are legal and encouraged to disrupt their trajectory and
        gain advantage.</p>
    <p>Ending the Game: The game concludes when a player reaches 7 points first.</p>
    <h2 class="new-page">The Golden Rules of Golf Croquet</h2>
    <p>Understand the main rules that govern the spirit and play of Golf Croquet:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Respect your opponent and maintain sportsmanship at all times.</li>
        <li>Always play in the sequence and follow the rules without bending them.</li>
        <li>Strive for strategic thinking over just power shots.</li>
        <li>Remember, blocking and tactical plays are as important as hitting through hoops.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="new-page">Introduction to Association Croquet</h2>
    <p>Association Croquet is a more complex and strategic variant of the game that offers deeper tactical
        possibilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each turn can consist of multiple strokes if the player hits another ball, known as making a 'roquet'.</li>
        <li>The game emphasizes precise control and planning over multiple turns and sequences.</li>
        <li>It's played at a slower pace compared to Golf Croquet, with matches lasting longer due to the intricacies of
            the rules.</li>
    </ul>
