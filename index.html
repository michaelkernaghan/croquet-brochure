    <h1>How to Play Golf Croquet</h1>
    <p>A flat, rectangular lawn, ideally 35 yards long by 28 yards wide, offers the standard playing field, but any area
        of 4x5 proportion will do. </p>
    <img src="stdcrt.gif" alt="Cover Image">
    <p>This layout tests both the tactical and stroke skills of players.</p>
    <h2>Navigating the Route</h2>
    <p>Players compete to pass their balls through the same hoop in the correct sequence. The sequence is critical and
        requires strategic planning to optimize each shot. See the annotated diagram above displaying the standard sequence of
        hoops, offering new players a visual path to follow.</p>
    <h3>Rules and Gameplay Procedures</h3>
    <p>Objective: The aim is to be the first to pass the ball through the designated hoop, scoring one point per hoop.
    </p>
    <p>Turns and Play: Players hit their balls once per turn, attempting to pass through the current hoop. The order is
        based on ball colour - Blue, Red, Black, Yellow. The Blue and Black are partners, as are the Yellow and Red.</p>
    <p>Strategic Plays: Blocking and clearing opponent's balls are legal and encouraged to disrupt their trajectory and
        gain advantage.</p>
    <p>Ending the Game: The game concludes when a player reaches 7 points first.</p>
    <h2>Essential Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mallets:</strong> Crafted to offer a balanced swing suitable for the precision required in golf
            croquet.</li>
        <li><strong>Balls:</strong> Four standard colors (blue, red, black, yellow), designed to withstand various
            weather conditions and lawn textures.</li>
        <li><strong>Wickets:</strong> Robust metal hoops designed for repeated play, placed strategically to challenge
            the players.</li>
        <li><strong>Stake:</strong> A wooden post to end the game with; except in golf croquet where it is just an
            obstacle.</li>
        <li><strong>String and or Flags:</strong> To mark the boundaries.</li>
    </ul>
